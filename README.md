# Cory's Coding Quiz

## Description
This project was aimed at flexing our JavaScript muscles. On it's surface it is a simple quiz that can keep track of score and will even store your score along with your initials in local storage. This quiz is far from challenging, I just wanted to demonstrate the basic functionality of my code. The questions and answers can easily be modified at the top of the js file. I went the route of generating all HTML from JavaScript instead of a hiding or showing different HTML elements.
